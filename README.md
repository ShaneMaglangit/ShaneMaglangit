### ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hello! I'm Shane
I am a passionate developer who loves building applications and websites. I'm currently at my junior year taking up a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning under National University Manila in the Philippines. Along with my studies, I also work on freelance projects for clients looking to outsource a developer in building their products.

Outsite of work and studies, I enjoy joining programming competitions and hackatons. In my free time, I like to binge watch anime and documentaries.
