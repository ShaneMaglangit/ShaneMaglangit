### ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hello! I'm Shane
I am a passionate developer who works with both software and website projects. I'm still currently taking up a bachelor's degree in Computer Science under National University Manila in the Philippines. Along with my studies, I also work on some freelance projects for various clients looking to outsource a developer in building their products.

I do love competing with others and see what we can ideas can we generate and build. In my spare time I like to play games, watch anime, and read manga.
